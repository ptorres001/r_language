# Arithmetic and Variable Assignment

# The first part is arithmetic and the second part is variable assignment. 

1+1 # = 2

100-101 # = -1

5*10 # = 50

5/3 # = 1.6667

2^4 # = 16

100 * 2 + 54 # = 254

100 * (2+54) # = 5600

5%%2 # = 1

# This part is dedicated to variables

# Variables can be assigned one of two ways. The first is with the equals operator, standard in python too

b = 5

# Another is with the arrow indicator, which is a less than symbol right next to a dash

b <- 6 # This will overwrite the above b variable

# Both ways work
